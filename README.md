# Description

This is a website I made while doing the Advanced CSS and Sass Udemy course from Jonas Schmedtmann. The project was made in order to learn the following:

- CSS techniques to create advanced designs and effects
- Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition
- How CSS works behind the scenes: the cascade, specificity, inheritance
- CSS architecture: component-based design, BEM, writing reusable code
- Float layouts (although it's not a modern approach, the purpose was to better understand the way older sites have been made)
- Using Sass in real-world projects: global variables, architecting CSS, managing media queries
- Advanced responsive design: media queries, mobile-first vs desktop-first
- Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads
- SVG images and videos in HTML and CSS: building a background video effect
- The NPM ecosystem: development workflows and building processes
